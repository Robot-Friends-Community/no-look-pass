<objective>
Create `HANDOFF-ALLEYOOP.md` in project root to preserve complete work state before clearing context.

Enables seamless resumption with `/slamdunk` in a fresh session.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@C:\Users\User\.claude\skills\no-look-pass-sessions\SKILL.md
</execution_context>

<process>

<step name="locate-project">
**Find project root:**

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd
```

Use this as the target directory for HANDOFF-ALLEYOOP.md.
</step>

<step name="detect-scaffolding">
**Check for active scaffolding systems:**

```bash
# GSD
test -f .planning/STATE.md && echo "gsd"

# Planning with files
test -f task_plan.md && echo "planning-files"

# Project log
test -f PROJECT_LOG.md && echo "project-log"
```

Store detected type for later.
</step>

<step name="gather-git-state">
**Capture uncommitted changes:**

```bash
git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repo"
git log -1 --oneline 2>/dev/null || echo "No commits"
```
</step>

<step name="gather-scaffolding-state">
**If GSD detected:**
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current phase/task
- Check for `.planning/phases/*/.continue-here.md`
- Note current milestone and phase number

**If planning-files detected:**
- Read `task_plan.md` for current status
- Note checked/unchecked items

**If project-log detected:**
- Read latest entry from `PROJECT_LOG.md`
</step>

<step name="gather-session-context">
**Collect from current session:**

1. **Objective** - What are we trying to accomplish?
2. **Completed** - What got done this session?
3. **Remaining** - What's left to do?
4. **Decisions** - Key choices made and why?
5. **Blockers** - Anything stuck or problematic?
6. **Next action** - Specific first thing to do when resuming?

**If any of these are unclear**, ask the user to clarify.
</step>

<step name="write-handoff">
**Write HANDOFF-ALLEYOOP.md to project root:**

```markdown

project: [folder name]
